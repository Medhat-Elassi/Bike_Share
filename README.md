# Bike_Share
In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. Statistics Computed: Popular times of travel, Popular stations and trip, Trip duration and User info.
